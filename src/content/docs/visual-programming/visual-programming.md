# What is Visual Basic

Visual Basic is a legacy programming language developed by Microsoft. It enables developers to create Windows-based applications using a visual interface and event-driven code.
It still used for maintaining older systems and is a great starting point for programming concepts.

# Getting Started with the VB IDE

**How to Install VB IDE:** Visual Basic development is typically done within the Visual Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Download and install the appropriate version of [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (e.g., Visual Studio 2022) from the Microsoft website. Ensure you select the "Desktop development with [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)" workload during installation, which includes Visual Basic support.

**Create a New Project:** 
- Open Visual Studio.
- Select "Create a new project."
- In the "Create a new project" dialog, search for "Visual Basic" and filter by "Windows" and "Desktop" to find relevant templates.
- Choose a template like "Windows Forms App (.NET Framework)" or "WPF App (.NET Framework)" for desktop applications, or "Console App" for command-line applications.
- Give your project a name and choose a location to save it.
