## About 

Visual programming languages (VPLs) allow users to build programs 
by dragging and connecting visual components. Instead of writing lines of code,
you manipulate blocks that represent logic, actions, or data flow. This method 
reduces syntax errors and helps users focus on problem-solving and logic.
